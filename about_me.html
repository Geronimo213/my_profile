                  I was born on the morning of February 13, 1997 in Little Rock, Arkansas. I was born at U.A.M.S Hospital. I have lived in Little Rock my entire life and although it's not the bustling city that I would prefer, I do enjoy the peace, quiet, and lack of traffic that comes with suburban life. I will always love my home city, no matter how far from home I end up.

                I am currently attending the University of Texas at Dallas as an undergraduate planning to graduate in the year 2019. I am majoring in Computer Science with an emphasis in software engineering, but I am also heavily involved in foreign language (especially French) and philosophy. My dream is to work for a large tech company (Google please?!?!) and work with others to solve problems through the power computers. I love Dallas and I love my school.

                  One of my all-time favorite hobbies is video games. I love playing a variety of video games on multiple platforms. Whether it's a MMO on the PC or Kingdom Hearts on the PS4, I love plaing video games. The only thing I might like more, however, is recording and live-streaming video games for people to watch on the internet. So I created Geronim0Games, which is a YouTube and Twitch.tv channel in which I play video games, chill out, and have a great time.
